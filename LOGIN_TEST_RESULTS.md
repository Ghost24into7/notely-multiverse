# 🚀 Frontend Login Test Results

## ✅ **Backend is Working!**
The API is responding correctly - MongoDB connection is fixed.

## ❌ **Issue Found: Test Accounts Missing**
The backend responds with "Invalid email or password" which means the test accounts aren't seeded in your production database.

## 🔧 **Quick Fix: Add Environment Variable to Seed Data**

You need to set up the test accounts in production. Here's how:

### **Option 1: Add to Vercel Environment Variables**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your backend project: `notely-multiverse`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add a new variable:
   - **Name:** `SEED_ON_START`
   - **Value:** `true`
5. **Redeploy** your backend

### **Option 2: Test with Browser Console**
1. Go to: https://notely-multiverse-ysqx.vercel.app/login
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Try clicking any test account button and login
5. Check for any error messages in console

### **Expected Test Accounts:**
- `admin@acme.test` / `password` (Admin, Acme)
- `user@acme.test` / `password` (Member, Acme)
- `admin@globex.test` / `password` (Admin, Globex)
- `user@globex.test` / `password` (Member, Globex)

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Add the SEED_ON_START environment variable** to Vercel
2. **Redeploy** the backend
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment
4. **Test login** again on the frontend

The frontend should work perfectly once the test accounts are seeded! 🎉

## 🆘 **Alternative: Manual Database Check**
If seeding doesn't work, you may need to:
1. Connect to MongoDB Atlas directly
2. Check if the `users` and `tenants` collections exist
3. Manually run the seed script

**Your backend API is working correctly - just need the test data! 🚀**
